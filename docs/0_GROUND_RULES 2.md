# Ground Rules

## Stack

| Layer | Technology | Version |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| [Layer] | [Technology] | [Version] |

> **The stack above is fixed.** Do not introduce alternatives without explicit approval.

## Inviolable Rules

1. **No new dependencies** without explicit user approval
2. **No unrelated refactoring** — one concern per task
3. **No file renaming or deletion** outside task scope
4. **All user-facing text** via i18n (if enabled) — never hardcode strings
5. **Validation** at system boundaries (Zod, Pydantic, etc.)
6. **No secrets** on the client side — service keys stay server-side
7. **Atomic changes** — each PR addresses one concern
8. **Build and lint** must pass before push
9. **No raw HTML rendering** — all user/DB content must be rendered via framework elements (components, template engines, etc.). If raw HTML is unavoidable (e.g. `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`, `v-html`, `innerHTML`), sanitise with DOMPurify or equivalent before rendering
10. **Repo is the single source of truth** — all data that enters the database (schema, seed, content, configuration) must originate from files in this repository. Nothing is inserted directly into the database via UI, admin tools, or any mechanism that bypasses the repo.

## Lint Warnings Policy

- **Errors:** must be zero before any task is complete
- **Warnings:** new warnings introduced by your changes must be fixed; pre-existing warnings are acceptable

## Protected Files (Read-Only)

These files are managed automatically — **NEVER edit**:

- [e.g. Auto-generated types]
- `.env` / `.env.local` / `.env.production`
- `.gitignore`
- Lock files (`package-lock.json`, `bun.lockb`, `poetry.lock`)
- [e.g. Database migrations]

## Publishing Checklist

Before any deploy to production, verify:

- [ ] **Page title set** — meaningful title in browser tab and search results
- [ ] **Meta description written** — concise, keyword-relevant summary
- [ ] **OG image set** — social sharing preview image (1200×630px recommended)
- [ ] **Favicon added** — visible in browser tab
- [ ] **Mobile design verified** — tested on real device or responsive mode
- [ ] **Security check passed** — no exposed secrets, auth flows tested, access control verified
- [ ] **Analytics enabled** — tracking configured (if applicable)
- [ ] **Build passes** — `npm run build` (or equivalent) completes without errors
- [ ] **Performance acceptable** — page loads in <3s on mobile connection

> Remove this section if the project is a CLI tool, library, or internal service.
