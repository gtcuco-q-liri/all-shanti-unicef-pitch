# Content & Social Media Strategy

> Remove this file if the project has no public-facing content or social media presence (e.g. CLI tools, internal apps, APIs).

## Brand Voice

> Distinct from `docs/3_UI_UX_GUIDELINES.md` §Emotional Tone: that one guides *UI design* decisions (spacing, color, motion). This one guides *written content* (blog, social, marketing copy). They should be consistent with each other but are not the same table — don't merge them.

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Tone** | [e.g. calm, intelligent, premium — or: playful, direct, bold] |
| **Emotional keywords** | [3-5 adjectives that describe how the brand should *feel*] |
| **Intellectual position** | [e.g. thought leader, practical helper, provocateur, educator] |
| **What we are NOT** | [e.g. aggressive, salesy, clickbait, jargon-heavy] |

### Editorial Rules

- [e.g. One central thesis per piece of content]
- [e.g. Short paragraphs, slow rhythm, prefer clarity over density]
- [e.g. Never use call-to-action language in thought leadership content]
- [e.g. Always back claims with data, examples, or observable behavior]

## Platforms

### Active Channels

| Platform | Purpose | Frequency | Primary audience |
|----------|---------|-----------|-----------------|
| [e.g. Blog] | [e.g. Long-form thought leadership] | [e.g. 2x/month] | [e.g. Property owners, investors] |
| [e.g. LinkedIn] | [e.g. Professional insight, behavioral lens] | [e.g. 3x/week] | [e.g. Decision-makers, founders] |
| [e.g. Instagram] | [e.g. Visual + emotional connection] | [e.g. 4x/week] | [e.g. Guests, lifestyle audience] |

## Technical SEO & AEO

> Merged from the former `4_SEO_AND_AEO.md` (removed in the v2.0 restructure — this file is now the single home for SEO/AEO/GEO, both technical and editorial). If this project has no public-facing content, remove this whole file per the note at the top.

### Meta Tags

- [e.g. SEOHead component: title <60 chars, description <160 chars, canonical URL]
- [e.g. Open Graph tags for social sharing]

### Semantic HTML

- One `<h1>` per page
- Sequential heading hierarchy (h1 → h2 → h3)
- Use semantic elements (`<nav>`, `<main>`, `<article>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`)
- ARIA labels where needed

### Structured Data (JSON-LD)

| Schema | Where |
|--------|-------|
| [e.g. LocalBusiness] | [page/component] |
| [e.g. FAQPage] | [page/component] |

> See §GEO Layer → Technical Requirements below for the full list of schema types AI answer engines expect.

### Images

- Descriptive `alt` text on all images
- Lazy loading for below-the-fold images
- Optimised formats (WebP for web, JPG for social)

### Sitemap & Robots

- `public/sitemap.xml` — auto-generated or manual
- `public/robots.txt` — allow all public content, explicitly allow AI crawlers:

```
# AI crawlers — explicitly allowed for GEO visibility

```

> This list rots — AI crawlers are added faster than any static doc can track. Re-verify against a current source (e.g. Cloudflare's or Google's crawler lists) before relying on it.

### llms.txt

Create a `public/llms.txt` file with a structured summary of the project for LLM consumption. This is the AI equivalent of an elevator pitch — read by LLMs before they process your content.

```markdown
# [Brand Name]

> [One-line description]

[2-3 sentences about what the project/company does]

## [Key sections: Products, Services, Locations, Contact, Key Facts]

[Structured, factual information]
```

> Without `llms.txt`, AI must infer what your site is from HTML — and may misinterpret it. With it, every AI that visits your site gets a clear, structured briefing.

## Blog / Long-Form Content

### Article Structure

| Section | Purpose | Guidelines |
|---------|---------|------------|
| **Title** | First impression + search signal | Strong point of view, not descriptive. Include 1 searchable term naturally. Avoid forced SEO keywords |
| **Metadata** | Context | Author, date, estimated reading time |
| **TL;DR** (4-5 lines) | Condensed answer for AEO extraction | Write as a complete answer, not a teaser. Must make sense if extracted by an AI engine |
| **Key Takeaways** (4-6 bullets) | Scannable value | Complete statements, not fragments. Each answers "what should I know?" |
| **Body sections** (3-5) | Core content | Each section has a clear H2. First sentence of each section is a declarative statement (AEO extraction target). Mix narrative with practical application |
| **Brand application** (1 section) | Credibility | How these principles connect to the brand's work. Institutional tone, not promotional |
| **Conclusion** | Synthesis | Reinforce central idea. Leave the reader with clarity, not urgency |
| **FAQ** (3-5 questions) | SEO + AEO | Questions phrased as users would ask them. Direct answers in first 1-2 sentences. Supports FAQ schema markup |
| **Tags / Categories** | Consistency | Aligned with strategic themes. Consistent across all articles |

### SEO Layer (Blog)

- **Title:** Contains central idea + primary searchable term (natural, not forced)
- **First paragraph:** Explicitly states the topic. Declarative writing ("X is...", "Y works because...")
- **Subtitles (H2/H3):** At least some framed as questions or clear statements close to human search language
- **Semantic repetition:** Key terms reappear naturally throughout. Avoid excessive synonyms that confuse indexing
- **FAQ:** Real questions, phrased as users would search. Direct answers in first 1-2 sentences
- **Tags/categories:** Consistent across articles. Aligned with strategic themes

### AEO Layer (Blog)

- **Concise answer blocks:** 1-2 declarative sentences per section, under 40 words. Structure: "X is important because Y." Shorter, self-contained passages are easier for answer engines to extract cleanly than long, qualified paragraphs
- **TL;DR as extractable answer:** Written as a condensed response, not a teaser. Must be citable by answer engines
- **Key Takeaways as complete statements:** Each bullet implicitly answers "what should I know?"
- **Explanatory language:** Prioritize "why" and "how" over "what"
- **Explicit authority:** Brand name referenced naturally in the body. Associate ideas with the brand's way of thinking
- **Clarity > originality:** Ideas can be sophisticated, but formulation must be simple and extractable by AI
- **Structured data:** Implement JSON-LD schema (Article, FAQPage, BreadcrumbList). Comprehensive schema markup makes content easier for AI crawlers to parse into citable facts
- **Raw HTML content:** Ensure content appears in HTML source, not generated via JavaScript only

### GEO Layer (Generative Engine Optimization)

GEO targets AI-powered search (ChatGPT, Perplexity, Google AI Overviews, Claude). Unlike SEO (ranking) and AEO (featured snippets), GEO optimizes for **being cited as a source** in AI-generated answers.

#### Content Principles

- **Factual density > keyword density:** Data, numbers, verifiable claims get cited. Narrative and opinion do not
- **Declarative statements:** At least 1-2 per section in the format "X is Y because Z." AI extracts these as citable facts
- **Content freshness:** Update key content on a regular cadence (e.g. every 1-2 weeks for fast-moving topics). Stale content with no visible update signal tends to lose citation priority over time — track your own citation rate before and after refreshes rather than assuming a fixed decay window
- **Quick answer blocks:** First 40 words of each section should be a complete, standalone answer
- **Schema stacking:** Multiple JSON-LD types on the same page (e.g. Article + FAQPage + Organization) — gives answer engines more structured surface area to extract from than a single schema type

#### Citability Checklist

High citability formats (prioritize these):
- [ ] Lists and rankings ("Top X...", "Best Y for Z")
- [ ] Comparison tables with specific data
- [ ] Clear definitions ("X is...")
- [ ] Data with sources and dates
- [ ] FAQ with direct answers

Low citability (use for humans, not AI extraction):
- Narrative / opinion / storytelling
- Metaphors without explanation
- Vague or poetic language

#### Technical Requirements

- **robots.txt:** see §Technical SEO & AEO → Sitemap & Robots above for the full AI-crawler allowlist
- **llms.txt:** see §Technical SEO & AEO → llms.txt above
- **JSON-LD completeness:** Ensure all 8 critical schema types are covered where applicable: Organization, Person, LocalBusiness, Product/Service, FAQPage, Article, Review/AggregateRating, BreadcrumbList
- **Raw HTML:** Content must be in HTML source code, not JavaScript-rendered only. Many AI crawlers cannot execute JavaScript

#### GEO Monitoring

- Monitor brand mentions in ChatGPT, Perplexity, Google AI Overviews (manual checks until tooling matures)
- Track if content appears as cited source in AI answers
- Compare citation frequency before/after content updates to calibrate freshness cycles

## Social Media — Short-Form Content

### Instagram / Visual Platforms

| Element | Guidelines |
|---------|------------|
| **Anchor idea** | One observation about human behavior, perception, or decision. Not copy yet — the idea that guides everything |
| **Image** | Real or AI-conceptual, simple and clean. Suggests feeling, doesn't explain concept. Confirms the idea emotionally, doesn't illustrate literally |
| **Opening** (1-2 visible lines) | Short, intuitive, almost obvious — but subtly provocative. Human language, not technical |
| **Body** (2-4 lines) | Introduce insight without jargon. Show how people make decisions. Implicit application to brand context |
| **Brand signature** (1 line) | Soft connection to brand positioning. Don't sell, don't explain. Show there's a system of thought behind it |
| **Emotional close** (1 line) | Phrase that closes the emotional cycle. Not a direct question — a mental echo. Should make the reader pause before scrolling |

#### AEO + Algorithm Training (Visual Platforms)

- **First sentence:** Simple, universal, declarative statement
- **Caption:** Avoid opaque metaphors without explanation. Introduce "why" implicitly
- **Thematic consistency:** Same concepts repeated over weeks. Helps algorithms associate the account with clear themes
- **Strategic hashtags:** Few, for thematic classification — not mass reach
- **Extractable text:** Sentences that make sense outside the visual context. Important for AEO and cross-platform redistribution
- **Fixed hashtags:** [Define project-specific hashtags to use on every post]

### LinkedIn / Professional Platform

| Element | Guidelines |
|---------|------------|
| **Hook** (1-2 lines) | Counterintuitive statement. Questions an "obvious" belief. Not about technique — about human behavior |
| **Insight expansion** (3-5 lines) | Explanation grounded in behavioral patterns. Show how seemingly rational decisions are emotionally driven |
| **Brand framing** (1-2 lines) | How the brand designs systems that reduce human error. Emphasis on predictability, clear signals, structure |
| **Reflective close** (1-2 lines) | Reinterprets the problem, doesn't close it. May raise a doubt or invert the logic. Goal: make the reader rethink how they make decisions |

#### LinkedIn Optimization

- **Length:** 90-180 words per post. Optimize for dwell time (45+ seconds reading)
- **First 2 lines:** Clear declarative sentences. Extractable as answers ("X happens because Y")
- **Consistent vocabulary:** Repeat anchor terms over time (e.g. predictability, risk, decision-making, assets). Avoid excessive creative synonyms
- **Logical structure:** Problem → behavioral cause → reframing → implication. Facilitates citation by answer engines and AI
- **Explicit authority:** Natural reference to the brand as a way of thinking, not as a commercial entity
- **Reflective close:** Formulation that can be quoted in isolation. Complete sentences, not vague slogans
- **No commercial CTA:** Never include sales calls-to-action in thought leadership posts

## Image Strategy

| Type | When to use | Examples |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **AI conceptual** | Abstract ideas, systems, perception | Behavioral concepts, decision frameworks |
| **Real photography** | Territory, context, operations | Locations, spaces, real situations |
| **Simple diagrams** | Processes, comparisons, data | Flowcharts, comparison tables, timelines |

### Image Rules

- [e.g. Every image must have alt text that works as a standalone description]
- [e.g. OG images generated for every blog article (1200x630px)]
- [e.g. Consistent visual style across platforms]
- [e.g. No stock photography that feels generic]

---

## Content Calendar

| Day | Platform | Content type |
|-----|----------|-------------|
| [e.g. Mon] | [e.g. LinkedIn] | [e.g. Behavioral insight post] |
| [e.g. Wed] | [e.g. Instagram] | [e.g. Visual + emotional caption] |
| [e.g. Fri] | [e.g. Blog] | [e.g. Long-form article (bi-weekly)] |

---

## Metrics

| Platform | Primary metric | Target | Secondary metric |
|----------|---------------|--------|-----------------|
| Blog | [e.g. Organic traffic] | [e.g. +20%/quarter] | [e.g. Average time on page] |
| LinkedIn | [e.g. Dwell time, impressions] | [e.g. 45s+ average read] | [e.g. Profile views] |
| Instagram | [e.g. Saves, shares] | [e.g. 3%+ save rate] | [e.g. Reach] |

### AEO Metrics

| Metric | How to measure |
|--------|---------------|
| AI citation rate | Monitor brand mentions in ChatGPT, Perplexity, Google AI Overviews |
| Featured snippet ownership | Track position zero results for target queries |
| Schema validation | Regular checks via Google Rich Results Test |
| Cross-platform extraction | Track when social content is cited/referenced by AI engines |

---

## Cross-Platform Consistency

- **Same strategic themes** across all platforms (adapted to format, not reinvented)
- **Blog as source of truth** — social content derived from long-form articles
- **Vocabulary alignment** — anchor terms consistent across blog, LinkedIn, Instagram
- **Visual consistency** — same color palette, typography feel, image style across platforms
- **Entity consistency** — brand name, descriptions, and claims identical across all profiles and content (critical for AEO entity recognition)
